<font size=4.5><P>My name is Alice Sagun and I'm a grade 9 student attending St Edmund Campion Secondary School. Throughout this course I have learned that business technology is using any electronic device or software system that allows people working in this industry to sort data in a faster, organized, and efficient way. Knowing this I have been taught how to make use of various softwares. Some including; Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint, Google Slides, Wix.</P>
